							As a full-stack web developer, I am passionate about leveraging my
							skills and expertise to create elegant, user-friendly, and
							high-performance web applications. With a strong background in
							both front-end and back-end development, I have the ability to
							design, develop, and deploy robust and scalable web applications
							from scratch. My technical skills include proficiency in HTML/CSS,
							JavaScript, React, Node.js, PHP, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, GraphQL
							and Postgres. I have a proven track record of delivering quality
							work within deadlines, collaborating effectively with
							cross-functional teams, and continuously learning and adapting to
							new technologies and tools. I believe that a successful web
							application is not just about the code, but also about the user
							experience and the impact it creates. Therefore, I always keep the
							end-user in mind and strive to create applications that are not
							only functional but also delightful to use. If you're looking for
							a full-stack web developer who is passionate, dedicated, and
							results-driven, then look no further. Let's connect and explore
